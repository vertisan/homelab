# Homelab

I'm not a fan of maintaining overly general monorepos.   
For this reason, all IaaC for infrastructure is split into dedicated repositories and stored in [VRS-Factory Homelab](https://github.com/vrsf-homelab).  
Besides, for now, all repositories are private, but I see no obstacles to showing those interested what drives my homelab ;) Just let me know if you want to see them!  

Maybe in the future, I'll migrate these repositories here but .. not today :)
